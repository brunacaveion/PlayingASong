Before runnig the code:

Get the piano sound I used here: 

https://freesound.org/people/josefpres/sounds/641638/

Put it in the same place as the .cpp code is.

On project << properties << linker << input << Addtional Dependecies << edit : 

write down Winmm.lib and then press OK.

After this steps you are ready to rund the code (hopefully) without errors.
